  都错了

  第一句话的ceramic  认成了谷物

  纠正之后仍然不理解 第一题

  Harry investigated whether this correlation of ceramic specialization with agricultural marginality occurred among prehistoric inhabitants of the American Southwest

  H 研究 瓷器特殊化和 农业边际是不是存在很久了 

  C suggest that inhabitants of the West Branch site may have had agricultural surpluses to use for trade with other settlements in the region

  已经拥有多余的来和其他人做trade

  Dpresent evidence to support a claim that the West Branch site was not a pottery consuming settlement

  证明这个点不是消费瓷器的

   ceramic production in excess of that needed for household purposes.

  证明了并不是为了生计 不知道为什么选D 不选C

  第二题是瓷器的单词影响

  marginality

  futility

- Harry investigated whether this correlation of ceramic specialization with agricultural marginality occurred among prehistoric inhabitants of the American Southwest
