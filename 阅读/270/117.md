  第四遍 一句句  看 看完概括每一句话 

  The border decoration in medieval manuscripts referred to as pen flourishing reached great artistic heights in the northern Netherlands in the 1400s. 

  1400的繁荣导致手稿装饰

  The regional variants in form that evolved make flourishing a useful tool for localizing and roughly dating manuscripts. 

  可以被用来考古

  When the first printed books appeared in that region, many copies were still traditionally decorated by hand with such flourishing.

  第一印刷书有装饰

  Since books’ publication can usually be dated with far more accuracy than manuscripts, studying these decorations in early printed books might lead to a more precise dating of the penwork in manuscripts. 

  研究书能更好的推算手稿

  It is of less help in localizing the flourishing. Upon completion, copies of printed books were often sold unadorned, to be decorated elsewhere as commissioned by their buyers.

  没用,都是买了之后装饰的

  

  才看懂文章写了什么
