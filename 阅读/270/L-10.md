  第三题定位

  Baldwin may have been attracted to James’s thematic focus on “the eternal outsider” as an alternative to the protest tradition of fiction, with its explicit social and political didacticism—a tradition that Baldwin found to be confining.

  B被J文章的一个特质所吸引  这句话理解不了 B认为谁是 confining? tradition指代谁?

  C 不对吗?

  E 选项说反了  less confining,  写成should be less confining 我觉着可以选
