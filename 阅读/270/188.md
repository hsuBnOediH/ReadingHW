- Abstract:

  270-188 2分47  句子主干抓不住

  Growing grapes in greenhouses containing air enriched with carbon dioxide increases crop yields, an effect that is enhanced when the growing temperature is also raised several degrees. 

  that ->when the growing temperature is also raised several degrees

  读第二遍 查单词 grape

  错第一题

  原文说 以后葡萄产量会增加 因为二氧化碳的增加

  Which of the following, if true, most weakens the argument

  When grapes are grown in greenhouses, it is relatively easy to control the grape pests that thrive in air enriched with carbon dioxide.

  当葡萄种在有大量二氧化碳的温室中, 害虫更好控制 

  二氧化碳多意味着害虫好控制

  室外二氧化碳多,室外害虫好控制, 室外产量也增加  是对原文的加强 不能选A　答案错了

  C Increasing carbon dioxide levels in greenhouses has not been shown to improve the quality of grapes grown in greenhouses.

  增加的二氧化碳和葡萄质量提高没关系

  直接反驳原文 选C
