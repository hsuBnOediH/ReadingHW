  两道题都错了 

  Moreover, in a recent study, **current speeds** upstream of the nest and at the nest entrance were similar for nests facing southeast and those facing in other directions. 

  这句话看反了意思  看成了两边速度不一样   主要以为 be similar for的不熟悉 

  A southeast-facing entrance *per se* thus seems to be the specific nest feature preferred by females, rather than the effect of selective positioning on current at nest entrance. 

  这句当时就没看懂  因为和我上一句 理解的流速不相同的理解相悖 

  文章方向完全错了
